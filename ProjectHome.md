Heres a quick one I threw together for all those people first setting up PS and need to remove bogus test orders.
My inspiration was this post http://www.prestashop.com/forums/viewthread/7828/ where there seemed to be lots of confusion.

Iâ€™ve tested this on v1.1.0.5 (Should work on 1.2, but not tested)

See the module instructions for exact info.

You have to check a box inside the config page, then click submit, only then will the orders be deleted.

You should uninstall/delete this module once your stores in production as it deletes ALL ORDERS!
